# Den of Evil

{video}

{You wanted to leave the city as fast as you could, and leave everything behind. All the things you have been through, all the death around you… the monsters. All your friends and companions are dead.. you are all alone now in this world. Or so he/she thought...
You decide to pack everything you can and be on your way.
A few days have passed and you find a car, hoping it still has gas and that the keys are still in the ignition. You scout the area carefully to see if there is any danger inside or in the vicinity of the car, it seems safe enough to get into the car. You get into the car and sit there for a while and then you start to cry, thinking back to a few days prior, to when your settlement was safe and not under attack by the mutant monsters. Suddenly an ear piercing sound flew through the car making you cover your ears, and you looked towards the direction of the sound. As you looked towards the direction you came from, a big and fierce monster like human stood there, locking its eyes in yours. Other mutant monsters started to show up behind the monstrosity that stood there. You panicked and searched everywhere for the keys to the car, the mutant monsters that showed up started running towards you as you kept searching for the keys, but one stayed behind, the one that shouted earlier just stood there… watching..
Lucky enough you find the keys and put them in the ignition and start to twist the keys back and forth trying to start the car, and say: 
“Shit, I forgot to check if it had any gas!”
The car starts just in time before the mutant monsters are able to get to you. 
And you were able to escape, but not very far. You were on the road for about an hour until the car just stopped, and it was out of gas.
You stop in the middle of a dense forest, surrounded by darkness and hearing the sounds of wildlife and screeches. The only sign of life you see is a few hundred meters away, on top of a hill. A church, clearly defeated by time. It’s cross has fallen from its place, rotating 180 degrees to form a satanic one instead. It’s not much, but it’s inside at least, you think to yourself. You unpack your car off the few necessities you have, strapping the iron pipe at your waist. You then enter the church which stands empty. Wooden rows of seats stand moldy in the main hall, and vegetation has started growing through cracks in the floor. You walk in further until you find a trapdoor not far behind the altar. You open it and see a dark, deep hole with no ladder. You do not even care if you survive anymore, so you jump down, falling a few meters.
